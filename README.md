# translate.py
This is a small program that takes two lists, zips them, and translates a file after making the translation dictionary.

If you want to test it, I've included testing files enDict.txt, deDict.txt, and testInput.csv.

If you run translate.py like this: "python ./translate.py enDict.txt deDict.txt testInput.csv <outputFileName.csv>" it should work.
